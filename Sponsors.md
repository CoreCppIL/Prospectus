# Sponsor Core C++!

Core C++ has a long-term mission to serve the needs of C++ developers in Israel and we are interested in partnering with companies that share that long-term vision.

Supporting and sponsoring Core C++ delivers value to companies in our community in a number of ways.

Value directly to companies that sponsor or have employees speak:

- **Recruitment** Nothing makes a company more attractive to community members when considering employment options than to see long-term community support as a sponsor and to see knowledgable speakers from that company talking about tackling challenging issues in interesting ways.
- **Image and awareness** Members will gain a favorable impression of sponsoring companies and companies with knowledgable employees speaking.
- **Product exposure** Swag opportunities and presentions expose members to new products and ideas.
- **Community influence** Presenting provides the opportunity to influence community thinking about tools, processes, libraries, and features.
- **Giving back** Sponsoring is a great way to support the community and be seen doing so.

Value to employees as attendees or speakers:

- **Better training** Employees that attend are better informed about best practices and new features and tools.
- **Better engagement** Employees that attend have higher morale and are excited about applying what they've learned.
- **Develop expertise** Researching a topic for a presentation is a valuable learning experience.
- **Better leaders** Employees that participate as group speakers or organizers are learning leadership skills not always available in their regular roles.

## Business Case

C++ Core is run by hard-nosed engineers and we aren't asking for charity or for companies to support us to "feel good." We are offering value for value.

We know that attracting talent is tough. Our group attracts engineers that are eager to develop their skills and stay current with best practices. By providing a speaker you have the opportunity to influence and impress that group. By being a Hosting Sponsor, you have the opportunity to treat them to a quick bite. Either way, your support is delivering value though it may be hard to measure in the near term.

When considering the sponsorship of a local developer community user group, the question of ROI (Return on Investement) occasionally comes up. The C++ developers who attend our user group are typically the top-professionals in their field.
If your company is hiring top-talent, then a long-term sponsorship commitment increases the chance that attendees will consider you when looking at options. Head-hunters and recruiters are typically paid 10% or more of starting salary for each technical hire such as our members. If you successfully hire just one of our members once every three or four years, that is *already* worth the sponsorship investement.
