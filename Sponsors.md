# Sponsor us!

There are many benefits for supporting and sponsoring our local users group.

- **Exposure:** Appearance on group page, mentions in the meetup. Good image and visibility for your company.
- **Education:** Attending the meetups increases knowledge in the community and specifically for any attending participant employees. This knowledge may directly impact your product quality.
- **Leadership:** If a company employee gives a talk - it is again a great way to talk about the company and show it technological leadership.
- **Introduction:** If you giving a talk it's an opportunity to get the name of the company out there and say a few words about it. If you are not speaking, you can send us a couple slides that we can present about your company at the start of the meeting.
- **Professionals:** Participants are often, skilled potential candidates (some are actively looking others may be persuaded).
- **Community:** Community contribution have always been a part of many companies' DNA - and this is certainly one way to do it.
- **Recruitment:** When hosting/sponsoring a meeting, you are most welcome to give a brief intro and its a great opportunity to recruit.
- **Advertising:** You are welcome to also raffle accessories such as licenses or tee shirts etc. 

## Costs

Support for our group is needed for the venew space and refreshments.  
These rarely surpass $250 per meeting (split approximately 50-50 between the rent and pizzas). Receipts and invoices will be presented for all actual expenses.

## ROI

When considering the sponsorship of a local developer community user group, the question of ROI (Return on Investement) occasionally comes up. 
The C++ developers who attend our user group are typically the top-professionals in their field.  
If your company is hiring top-talent, then a _long-term_ sponsorship commitment increases the chance that attendees will consider you when looking at options.  
Head-hunters and recruiters are typically paid 10% or more of starting salary for *each* technical hire such as our members. 
This means that if you successfully hire one of our members, once every three or four years that is worth all that sponsorship money and more.
